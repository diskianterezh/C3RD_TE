The golden penny became the pivot of the economy and trade for centuries. Gold became the reference for the tax system and imperial expenditure. Taxes were expressed in solidi, and sometimes in fractions of solidus. Fines, known from the Theodosian Code, were only expressed in gold from about 360 onwards. Military expenses, regular salaries and exceptional gratuities (donativa) were settled in solidi (hence the name 'soldat'). Through taxation, the solidi were returned to the state coffers to be recast into ingots, which allowed them to be counted by weight, and then recast. The solidi issued were used to pay troops, and based on the evaluation of the army's strength in the second half of the fourth century, the annual production of solidi is estimated at between 1 and 2 million pieces, and probably more during the major military mobilisations during conflicts. The Solidus is the origin of the words 'sol', 'sou', 'solde', 'soldat' and 'soldo''"
